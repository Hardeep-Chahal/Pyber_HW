Three observations from Pyber:

1)	First observation is that the data analysis conducted confirms the analyst’s assumption that more rides being taken in urban city types than rural or suburban city types. Reasons for this are due to: proximities of accessible items such as groceries, fast-food/causal diners, stores, etc. Due to this, and higher cost of living expenses associated with living in urban cities it does not make sense to own a vehicle. The cost of paying for a car, upkeep (maintenance), insurance, parking fees, and inspections would be costlier than to pay for fares to nearby places. 

2)	However, rural areas have less population, with local facilities farther in distance when compared to Urban lifestyles, example being farmers, who need vehicle(s) in order to sustain a living. Rural areas are not close to local facilities which justifies the reasons for vehicle expenses, as noted previously.  For the Suburban “types”, the analyst assumes that many have families which necessitates the need for vehicle(s). However, based on the ride counts which for rural maxed to 12, while Suburban saw rides average between 12 to 27. Suburban utilizing Pyber is assumed to be in relation to parents being busy from work or other obligations, and teens needing access for hobbies, school events, or social enjoyment. 

3)	Cost of fares, per all three city types observed showed that Rural citizens on average paid higher fares than other from suburbs or urban settings. As noted earlier, rural areas do not access Pyber as much therefore costs would be higher due to a limited supply and limited demand. With more people in urban locations, comes higher demand with enough supply to help keep average fare costs lower.
